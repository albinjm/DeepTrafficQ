# DeepTrafficQ
DeepTrafficQ is a reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control system that uses Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to minimize vehicle waiting times at a 4-way intersection. By leveraging Q-learning with experience replay and a convolutional neural network (CNN), the agent dynamically adjusts traffic light phases to optimize traffic flow.
